# What is it?
It's a template for a static blog.

# How do I use it?
You edit the index.html

The code is pretty self explanatory. Just copy and paste the review div to add a new post.

# License?
Distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. Read LICENSE.txt for more details

# Why aren't you making a php blog thing?
Well I'm not a web developer. I just did this for fun, and I like it.

If you want to help improve it, go for it.

# Mobile friendly?
Possibly. I've only tested on an iPhone 5c and iPad 2, and it's perfectly fine. You may have to add more code for more device support.
